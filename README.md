## Project Info
MiniNT (mint) is a Shell that runs on top of bare metal Windows NT (WinPE)
<br>
Unlike the original goal of Styphoonm, MiniNT will consist of Win32, Dialog and ʌttysymbols
<br>
This can either be run as a Window Manager on top of Explorer, or used as a daily driver (Windows PE)

## ʌttysymbols
#### What is ʌttysymbols?
AttySymbol(s) is a set of 2 json files that is rendered by Win32 as a window
<br>
Atty is still in its first stages of development, and can only do minimal things
<br>
very soon, this will change.
